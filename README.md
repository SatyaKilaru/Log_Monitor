This Python script provides a versatile solution for monitoring and analyzing log files, simplifying the detection and resolution of issues within log data. It focuses on real-time log monitoring and basic log analysis tasks, offering users a holistic approach to managing log files efficiently.

### Functionalities:

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The script continuously monitors a specified log file from a GitHub link, utilizing the 'tail' command for dynamic scanning and updates.
  
- **Logging and Error Handling:** Python's logging module is used to capture and organize log information with configurable levels like INFO and ERROR. Robust error handling ensures smooth operation even in unexpected scenarios.
  
- **Log Analysis:** Users can define custom keywords or patterns to detect specific events such as error messages or HTTP status codes. The script efficiently identifies relevant log entries using regular expressions and generates insightful summary reports.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository or download the `Log_File_Monitoring_Code.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the script by executing `python Log_File_Monitoring_Code.py`.
4. The script will monitor the log file from the provided GitHub link and save the results to `log_monitor.log`.

### Example:
## Running the Script

```bash
pip install requests
```

If you are using a specific Python version or if you have multiple Python versions installed, you might need to specify the Python version in the command, like this:
```bash
pip3 install requests
```

```python
python Log_File_Monitoring_Code.py
```
### Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Requests library

# Fishy.log Monitoring Script

This repository contains a Python script designed to monitor and extract specific information from a log file. The script is compatible with Python 3.x and can be used to monitor log files and extract specific information from them.

## Usage

To use and test the script, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Python 3.x is installed**: The script is compatible with Python 3.x. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. **Save the code**: Save the provided code in a file with a .py extension (e.g., script.py).

3. **Run the script**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is saved. Run the script using the following command: `python script.py`.

4. **Monitoring log file**: The script will start monitoring the log file specified in the code (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aliraza89/Using-Python-to-Interact-with-the-Operating-System/main/Working%20with%20Log%20Files/Data/fishy.log).

5. **Results and errors**: The results of the monitoring will be saved to a file named log_monitor. If the script encounters any errors or exceptions, they will be logged in the log_monitor file.

6. **Stop the script**: To stop the script, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+C in the terminal or command prompt. The script will log a message indicating that it has been stopped by the user.

7. **Testing with a different log file**: If you want to test the script with a different log file, you can modify the log_file variable in the script to point to the desired log file.

8. **Automatic downloading and processing**: The script will automatically handle the downloading and processing of the log file, and it will log any errors or exceptions that occur during this process.

Please note that the script is designed to monitor log files and extract specific information from them. It is not intended to be used for any other purpose.
