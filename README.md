This Python script provides a versatile solution for monitoring and analyzing log files, simplifying the detection and resolution of issues within log data. It focuses on real-time log monitoring and basic log analysis tasks, offering users a holistic approach to managing log files efficiently.

### Functionalities:

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The script continuously monitors a specified log file from a GitHub link, utilizing the 'tail' command for dynamic scanning and updates.
  
- **Logging and Error Handling:** Python's logging module is used to capture and organize log information with configurable levels like INFO and ERROR. Robust error handling ensures smooth operation even in unexpected scenarios.
  
- **Log Analysis:** Users can define custom keywords or patterns to detect specific events such as error messages or HTTP status codes. The script efficiently identifies relevant log entries using regular expressions and generates insightful summary reports.

### Usage:

1. Clone the repository or download the `Log_File_Monitoring_Code.py` file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the script by executing `python Log_File_Monitoring_Code.py`.
4. The script will monitor the log file from the provided GitHub link and save the results to `log_monitor.log`.

### Example:
## Running the Script

To execute the script, use the following command:

```bash
python log_monitor.py
